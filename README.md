Please look at the description to see what images to download with it
If you have any questions, comments or concerns please email joshuarauber08@gmail.com
You can add your own sprites to the lists but they must have exactly 9. 
If you would like to play it and edit it copy and paste it into your python code editor and drag the images in too. 
You must credit Joshua Rauber somewhere in your code.  
Make sure you have pygame, numpy and all of the other modules listed at the top of each program installed. Most of the time its simply python3 -m pip install (whatever)
